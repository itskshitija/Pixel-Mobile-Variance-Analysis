## ðŸ“‹ Introduction  
Pixel Mobile is a mobile manufacturing company. In 2023, the management team set production targets for their new Pixel Moon mobile models: Mini, Max, and Pro. To achieve these targets, they allocated specific production budgets for each region, factory, model, and month, determining the number of units to be produced.

This project focuses on conducting a **variance analysis** to evaluate the performance of production against these targets. Insights will help pinpoint areas of success and opportunities for improvement.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
The goal is to analyze production performance using variance analysis by focusing on two key aspects:  
1. **Region-wise Variance Analysis:**  
   - Determine actual vs. budgeted production for each region and identify gaps.  
2. **Model-wise Variance Analysis:**  
   - Evaluate which Pixel Moon models (Mini, Max, Pro) met or exceeded their targets and which fell short.  

This analysis will offer actionable insights for improving future production planning and allocation strategies.
