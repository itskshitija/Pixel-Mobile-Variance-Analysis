# Pixel Mobile Case Study: Variance Analysis  

## üìã Introduction  
Pixel Mobile, a mobile manufacturing giant, aimed to revolutionize the market with its Pixel Moon models: **Mini**, **Max**, and **Pro**. In 2023, management outlined clear production targets and allocated budgets by region, factory, and model.  

This project focuses on conducting a **variance analysis** to evaluate the performance of production against these targets. Insights will help pinpoint areas of success and opportunities for improvement.  

## üéØ Objective  
The goal is to analyze production performance using variance analysis by focusing on two key aspects:  
1. **Region-wise Variance Analysis:**  
   - Determine actual vs. budgeted production for each region and identify gaps.  
2. **Model-wise Variance Analysis:**  
   - Evaluate which Pixel Moon models (Mini, Max, Pro) met or exceeded their targets and which fell short.  

This analysis will offer actionable insights for improving future production planning and allocation strategies.  

## üìä Data Overview  
### Datasets Used:  
| Dataset             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Budget Sheet**    | Budgeted production targets by region, model, month, and factory.          |
| **Actual Sheet**    | Actual production details for all batches, including quantities produced.  |
| **Abbreviation Sheet** | Abbreviations and codes used in the dataset with their full explanations. |

### Data Structure:  
| **Column Name**     | **Description**                                                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Region              | Geographic area of production (e.g., North, South).                        |
| Factory             | Factory code where production occurred.                                    |
| Model               | Pixel Moon mobile model (Mini, Max, Pro).                                  |
| Month               | Month of production (Jan-Dec).                                             |
| Units Budgeted      | Expected production numbers for the given time period.                     |
| Units Produced      | Actual production numbers from the Actual Sheet.                           |
| Variance            | Difference between actual and budgeted production.                         |

## üí° Key Insights  

1. **Model:** The best performing model for us regarding production variance is "PRO". It has a lesser quantity production variance as compared to other two models.

2.**Region:** The best-performing region for us regarding production variance is "South". However all the regions had lower production than their budgeted production quantities.

3. **Quarter:** In "Q4", the company has positive production variance and in all other three quarters the variance is negative.

## üìå Conclusion  
This project provides actionable insights into production planning and execution. By identifying regions and models that consistently over/underperformed, Pixel Mobile can refine its strategies to achieve optimal efficiency and align budgets with actual performance.
